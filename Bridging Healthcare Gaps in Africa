### **Project Overview**

This project analyzes healthcare access across Africa, focusing on key aspects such as patient distribution, healthcare workforce, funding allocation, 
and accessibility in urban and rural areas. The goal is to identify gaps and provide data-driven recommendations to improve healthcare services.

---

### **Data Source**

The dataset was sourced from [Axia Africa]
It includes healthcare facility locations, funding distribution, doctor-to-patient ratios, emergency response times, and patient satisfaction levels.

---



### **Tools Used**

- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Power Query
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Power BI
- Data Visualization: Power BI
- DAX Calculations: Power BI (DAX)

---

### **Data Cleaning**

- Handled missing values in funding and patient visit records.
- Standardized healthcare facility names and regions.
- Filtered out duplicate or inconsistent entries.
- Ensured data integrity before analysis.

---

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Examined distributions of healthcare facilities by region.
- Analyzed urban vs. rural patient visit trends.
- Identified outliers in funding and workforce allocation.
- Correlated healthcare accessibility with patient satisfaction.

---

### **Data Analysis**

- Compared funding allocation between urban and rural areas.
- Assessed the efficiency of healthcare facilities by type (clinic, hospital, health center).
- Analyzed emergency response time versus funding levels.
- Measured workforce distribution and doctor-to-patient ratios.

---

### **Data Insights**

- Rural areas receive 53.3% of funding, yet they experience higher distances to healthcare facilities.
- Workforce distribution shows urban areas have 4.6 nurses per 1,000 patients, while rural areas have 1.5.
- Emergency response times are longer in rural regions despite higher funding allocation.
- Healthcare efficiency varies by facility type, with clinics serving the highest number of patients efficiently.

---

### **DAX Used in Power Query**

- Created measures to calculate doctor-to-patient and nurse-to-patient ratios.
- Used SUMX and AVERAGEX for patient visit trends.
- Applied IF & SWITCH statements to categorize response times.
- Developed calculated columns for funding received per facility type.

---

### **Results of DAX**

- Clear visualization of funding gaps and workforce shortages.
- Interactive breakdown of emergency response times per region.
- Dynamic insights into facility efficiency by urban and rural areas.

---

### **Recommendations**

- Increase workforce allocation in rural areas to balance doctor/nurse availability.
- Improve healthcare facility distribution to reduce the average distance to healthcare.
- Optimize funding utilization by linking funding directly to patient volume and needs.
- Enhance emergency response systems in underserved regions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The analysis highlights significant disparities in healthcare access across Africa. While funding is relatively balanced, workforce distribution and facility efficiency require optimization. Data-driven policymaking can enhance healthcare accessibility and satisfaction rates.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

Expand dataset to include more real-time patient feedback.

Integrate machine learning to predict patient needs and optimize resource allocation.

Develop an interactive web dashboard for real-time monitoring of healthcare accessibility.

This portfolio showcases a comprehensive analysis of healthcare access in Africa, backed by data-driven insights and actionable recommendations. Let's bridge the healthcare gap with informed decisions!
